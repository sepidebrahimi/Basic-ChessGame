# basic-chess

/*We will create a simple chess program that could complete chess game implementation. For now, you will create a basic chess board, and will indicate what chess pieces are on which squares on the board. The input file contains the position of the pieces and the moves they should make. Your job is to check if these moves are valid. If so, move the particular chess piece. If not, tell the user that the move is invalid.*/

You can make your own input file.
Make sure to put the right input path in the "ChessGame" driver.
