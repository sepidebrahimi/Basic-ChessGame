# basic-chess

/*We will create a simple chess program that could to a complete chess game implementation. For now, you will create a basic chess board. You will be given an input file that will indicate what chess pieces are on which squares on the board. Then the input file will also have you move these chess pieces. Your job is to check if these moves are valid. If so, move the particular chess piece. If not, tell the user that the move is invalid.*/

You can make your own input file.
Make sure to put the right input path in the "ChessGame" driver.
